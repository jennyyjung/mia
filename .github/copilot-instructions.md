# AI Coding Assistant Instructions

> **Note:** As of the time of writing, the workspace is essentially empty. There are
no source files or configuration to analyze. This document will grow as the project
acquires structure. For now, the guidance is intentionally minimal.

## Project Overview

- No code or directories exist yet. When components are added, update this section
to describe the overall architecture (web/mobile app, backend services, data
models, etc.).

## Conventions & Patterns

- No project-specific conventions detected. Once files are present, the AI agent
should look for recurring idioms (e.g. naming schemes, custom hooks, service
folders) and document them here.

## Build/Test/Debug

- There are no build or test commands available. Add `package.json`, `Makefile`,
`pom.xml`, etc., and update this section with relevant `npm run`, `dotnet`, or
other commands.

## Integration & Dependencies

- Without any manifest files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.), there
are no known external dependencies to describe.

## How to Help

If you are the repository owner, please add a README or some source files so
that AI agents can generate more meaningful instructions. When adding new
modules, consider documenting:

1. The purpose of each major folder.
2. Any setup/installation steps.
3. Specific coding patterns or helper utilities that should be reused.
